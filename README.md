# LiftLog

The workout tracker built with you in mind – stay consistent and see results.

## Motivation

LiftLog is designed for people who want a simple, no-nonsense way to log their workouts, monitor their gains, and stay motivated throughout their fitness journey. 

## Overview 

LiftLog is a SwiftUI-based application designed to empower users to track their workout progress. Inspired by Paul Hudson's 100 Days of SwiftUI, this project aims to provide a user-friendly and customizable workout logging experience.

**Current Features**

* **Activity Creation:** Effortlessly add new workout activities, including their name, completion count, and personal notes.
* **Progress Tracking:** Track the number of times you've completed each workout and monitor your improvement.
* **Notes for Reflection:** Capture essential details, observations, or motivational thoughts about your workouts.
* **Data Persistence:** Your workout data is safely stored using UserDefaults, ensuring your progress is preserved across app sessions.

## Technical Highlights

* **SwiftUI:** Built with the declarative power of SwiftUI, providing a modern and intuitive UI development experience.
* **Navigation:** Employs SwiftUI's `NavigationStack` and value-based navigation for seamless transitions between views.
* **Observation Framework:** Leverages Apple's Observation protocol and the `@Observable` macro to efficiently react to data changes and update the UI accordingly.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:** 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kevveth/LiftLog
    ```
2.  **Open in Xcode:** Open the `LiftLog.xcodeproj` file.
3.  **Build and Run:** Build and run the project on your iOS simulator or device.

## Future Development (Planned)

* **Workout Routines:** Implement the ability to create and manage structured workout routines.
* **Progress Visualization:**  Incorporate charts or graphs to visualize workout progress over time.
* **Advanced Data Storage:**  Explore alternative data storage methods like Core Data for more complex data relationships.
* **Set workout reminders or schedule workout sessions.**

## Learning from 100 Days of SwiftUI

This project has been a fantastic opportunity to apply the concepts and techniques learned from Paul Hudson's 100 Days of SwiftUI challenge. It has solidified my understanding of SwiftUI's core principles, state management, navigation, and data persistence.

## Let's Build Together!

I'm excited to continue developing LiftLog and welcome the collaboration of like-minded developers passionate about fitness and SwiftUI.
